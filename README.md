# IJOCSoftwareToolsArchive

An informal archive of the software submitted to the Software Tools
area of the INFORMS Journal on Computing. This repository is intended
for use only in the rare circumstance that the primary repository for
a particular piece of software disappears and this is the only place
to find the software. We do not plan to track changes in the primary
repositories.
